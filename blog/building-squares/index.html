<div class=content>
<p>In geometry, a square is a regular quadrilateral, which means that it has four equal sides and four equal angles (90-degree angles, or (100-gradian angles or right angles). It can also be defined as a rectangle in which two adjacent sides have equal length. A square with vertices ABCD would be denoted ◻ ABCD.</p>
<h2 id=price>Price</h2>
<p>The square is priced at <code>
$ 4 </code>.</p>
<h2 id=characterizations>Characterizations</h2>
<p>A convex quadrilateral is a square if and only if it is any one of the following</p>
<ul>
<li>a rectangle with two adjacent equal sides</li>
<li>a rhombus with a right vertex angle</li>
<li>a rhombus with all angles equal</li>
<li>a parallelogram with one right vertex angle and two adjacent equal sides</li>
<li>a quadrilateral with four equal sides and four right angles</li>
<li>a quadrilateral where the diagonals are equal and are the perpendicular bisectors of each other, i.e. a rhombus with equal diagonals</li>
<li>a convex quadrilateral with successive sides a, b, c, d whose area is A = 1/2(a<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup>) = 1/2(b<sup>2</sup> + d<sup>2</sup>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=properties>Properties</h2>
<p>A square is a special case of a rhombus (equal sides, opposite equal angles), a kite (two pairs of adjacent equal sides), a trapezoid (one pair of opposite sides parallel), a parallelogram (all opposite sides parallel), a quadrilateral or tetragon (four-sided polygon), and a rectangle (opposite sides equal, right-angles) and therefore has all the properties of all these shapes, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>The diagonals of a square bisect each other and meet at 90°</li>
<li>The diagonals of a square bisect its angles.</li>
<li>Opposite sides of a square are both parallel and equal in length.</li>
<li>All four angles of a square are equal. (Each is 360°/4 = 90°, so every angle of a square is a right angle.)</li>
<li>All four sides of a square are equal.</li>
<li>The diagonals of a square are equal.</li>
<li>The square is the n=2 case of the families of n-hypercubes and n-orthoplexes.</li>
<li>A square has Schläfli symbol. A truncated square, t, is an octagon. An alternated square, h, is a digon.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=other-facts>Other facts</h2>
<ul>
<li>A square can also be defined as a parallelogram with equal diagonals that bisect the angles.</li>
<li>If a figure is both a rectangle (right angles) and a rhombus (equal edge lengths), then it is a square.</li>
<li>If a circle is circumscribed around a square, the area of the circle is π / 2 (about 1.5708) times the area of the square.</li>
<li>If a circle is inscribed in the square, the area of the circle is π / 4 (about 0.7854) times the area of the square.</li>
<li>A square has a larger area than any other quadrilateral with the same perimeter.</li>
<li>A square tiling is one of three regular tilings of the plane (the others are the equilateral triangle and the regular hexagon).</li>
<li>The square is in two families of polytopes in two dimensions: hypercube and the cross-polytope.</li>
<li>The square is a highly symmetric object. There are four lines of reflectional symmetry and it has rotational symmetry of order 4 (through 90°, 180° and 270°). Its symmetry group is the dihedral group D4.</li>

<article>
Machining is any process in which a cutting tool is used to remove small chips of material from the workpiece (the workpiece is often called the &ldquo;work&rdquo;). To perform the operation, relative motion is required between the tool and the work. This relative motion is achieved in most machining operation by means of a primary motion, called &ldquo;cutting speed&rdquo; and a secondary motion called &ldquo;feed&rdquo;.[7] The shape of the tool and its penetration into the work surface, combined with these motions, produce the desired shape of the resulting work surface.

<article>
The three principal machining processes are classified as turning, drilling and milling. Other operations falling into miscellaneous categories include shaping, planing, boring, broaching and sawing.[5]
Turning operations are operations that rotate the workpiece as the primary method of moving metal against the cutting tool. Lathes are the principal machine tool used in turning. Milling operations are operations in which the cutting tool rotates to bring cutting edges to bear against the workpiece.

<article>
Machining is any of various processes in which a piece of raw material is cut into a desired final shape and size by a controlled material-removal process. The processes that have this common theme, controlled material removal, are today collectively known as subtractive manufacturing,[1] in distinction from processes of controlled material addition, which are known as additive manufacturing. Exactly what the &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; part of the definition implies can vary, but it almost always implies the use of machine tools (in addition to just power tools and hand tools).
