With a career journey spanning through diverse roles and industries, I bring a wealth of experience in production planning, supply chain management, and a fervent passion for data analytics and storytelling.

## Professional journey
My professional journey commenced in the dynamic realm of supply chain management, where I honed my skills as an Above Market Planner in the pharmaceutical industry. My role as a Supply Chain Assistant Intern and later as a Junior Production Manager equipped me with hands-on experience, fostering a deep understanding of production planning and inventory management.

## Data Enthusiast & Problem Solver
Fuelled by a passion for data, I embarked on a journey into the world of analytics and became a certified Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst. Expanding my horizons, I delved into machine learning, ensemble learning methods, and deep learning, crafting diverse personal projects from predictive maintenance to customer segmentation and predictive churn analysis.

My toolbox encompasses a repertoire of technical prowess, including SQL, Power BI, SAP,and a proficiency in various machine learning methodologies. I take pride in my ability to unravel complex problems, narrating compelling data stories, and collaborating seamlessly within a team while maintaining autonomy.

## Beyond Work
When I'm not immersed in coding or delving into data, you'll find me unwinding with video games like Age of Empires 2, GTA V, or FIFA. I am an ardent follower of live sports, particularly soccer, and relish spending quality time with my family and friends.
